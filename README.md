# Gadget
**Gadget** is a library that aims to _make analytics event tracking_ **more reliable** and **configurable**.<br>

### Problems to solve
Here're a few problems that **Gadget** tries to solve.

1. Managing the tracking of the events to n platforms from a single point.
2. Adding or removing an analytics plafrom easily
3. Configuring of event tracking for different screens or conditions.
4. Google Enhanced Ecommerce implementation easier.  

### How to use?
First you need to setup **Gadget** in your **application**.
```KOTLIN
class MyAwesomeApp : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Gadget.setup(this)
    	// .. other stuff
    }
}
```
By default **Gadget** uses it's own tracker which is called ```DefaultEventTracker``` and tracks to **Firebase Analytics** by default.
```KOTLIN
open class DefaultEventTracker(private val firebaseEventTracker: EventTracker) : EventTracker {
```
To customize the event tracking in your app, you can define your own tracker by implementing **EventTracker**
```KOTLIN
interface EventTracker {
    /*
     * Tracking function
     * Tracks the given event
     */
    fun track(event: Event)
}
```

After creating your custom event tracker, you can pass it to Gadget and use **your own tracker**.
```KOTLIN
Gadget.setup(this,myAwesomeCustomEventTracker)
```

Secondly, you should create **your own events** or you can use directly **Gadget's pre-defined events**. Your own events should impement Gadget's ```Event``` interface.
```KOTLIN
/*
 * Event
 * Generic Event interface
 * Every event has a name and params
 */
interface Event
```
If this event will be tracked to Firebase Analytics as well, you should implementd Gadget's ```FirebaseEvent``` interface. This interface has a default ```bundle``` implementation and you can override this bundle conversion anytime you want in your own event. (You can notice that some predefined **EEC events** has different ```bundle``` conversions.)
```KOTLIN
/*
 * Firebase Event
 * Defines the events that will be tracked to Firebase Analytics
 */
interface FirebaseEvent : Event {
    /*
     * Converts the event to bundle to track Firebase Analytics
     */
    fun toBundle(): Bundle {
        val bundle = Bundle()
        if (params.isNotEmpty()) {
            for (param in this.params) {
                bundle.put(param.key, param.value)
            }
        }

        return bundle
    }
} 
```

Instead of implementing your own events, you can directly use **Gadget's** ```CustomEvent``` for event tracking.
```KOTLIN
val addEvent = CustomEvent("content_add")
addEvent.putParam("type", "message")
```

And finally, you can track your event with ```Gadget```
```KOTLIN
Gadget.track(addEvent)
```

IF you want to change the event tracking strategy for a single event specifically **Gadget's track method** takes ```EventTracker``` as parameter and if you pass a different event tracker, your event will be tracked with that implementation.

### Gadget's Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce Support
Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce reporting allows you to collect data related to ecommerce transactions: item data, impression data, product data, promotion data, and action data. This information gives you a snapshot of your companyâ€™s health by providing an overarching view of how visitors interact with your ecommerce website. [Source and more information here](https://thegood.com/insights/google-analytics-enhanced-ecommerce/)

Gadget has it's own impression trackers can be used for EEC impression tracking. You can use ```EecProductImpressionTracker``` for product impression tracking and 
```EecPromotionImpressionTracker``` for tracking your promotions. These trackers both implements **Gadget's** ```ListItemImpressionTracker<T>``` and ```LifecycleEventTracker``` implements to handle impression tracking in a with **lifecycle events**.

To collect the impressions, you can use ```addImpression``` method of ```ListItemImpressionTracker```
```KOTLIN
    /*
     * Function to track item impression
     * Call when item is viewed
     */
    fun addImpression(item: T) {
        viewedItems.add(item)
    }

    /*
     * Function to track item impression with a mapper
     * Call when item is viewed
     */
    fun addImpression(item: Any?, mapper: Function<Any, T>) {
        item?.let {
            viewedItems.add(mapper.apply(it))
        }
    }
```

To track an item selection, you can use ```trackItemSelection``` method of ```ListItemImpressionTracker```
```KOTLIN
/*
 * Tracks selection of an item in a list
 * Measure product clicks by logging a SELECT_CONTENT event
 * with an item (i.e. product) defined with the relevant fields:
 */
 fun trackItemSelection(item: T)
```

And finally, **Gadget's** ```EecProductImpressionTracker``` will track the collected impressions ```@OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE)```

**Note:** You can notice that there're some out dated classes and implementations for **EEC support**. **Google Analytics 4 migration** is still on going and i'm trying to understand and replace these deprecated classes with the GA 4 implementations.
